# sign-up-form
Intermediate CSS assignment completed as part of The Odin Project full stack web dev course

In this assignment I've tried to create a responsive sign-up form that can resize dynamically with he browser window. 

I've also used JavaScript to check the passwords match and when they dont to inform the user with an additional label, which is generated using a psuedo element.
